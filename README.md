Attempt to estimate the total spend of Swiss HEI for APC in Gold and Hybrid journals.


Results:

2020: actual = $19,568,654.65 | estimated = $31,413,862.94

2021: actual = $30,756,807.62 | estimated = $45,449,795.41

2022: actual = $32,604,462.88 | estimated = $47,925,793.59

2023: actual = $35,926,578.03 | estimated = $52,644,104.17

2024: actual = $34,151,506.22 | estimated = $49,259,504.85


Please note:

1) For about 40% of all publications, no APC could be determined (hence the differences between actual and estimated above). For each missing journal and year, the median APC of the respective publisher was used; if the publisher could not be determined, the median APC across the entire dataset was used.
2) The underlying data includes Gold and Hybrid-publications by corresponding authors from Swiss Institutions. While the corresponding author should often match the institution which has paid for the publication, there is no guarantee that this is truly the case.
3) The prices are in all likelihood too high: The Swiss HEI have Transformative Agreements in place with a range of publishers which should cover some 50-75% of all publications (see https://consortium.ch/vertraege-konditionen/?lang=en). These TA usually contain a discount of 10-20% on the list prices used in this analysis. Therefore, reducing the above prices by 10% would probably be prudent.
4) no guarantee is given for correctness of the data, code, caluclations or results.
